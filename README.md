#
# Notes:
#
#	This module utilizes personal Twitter's user-specific API
#	information to perform OAuth connection to Twitter and submit either a
#	Tweet or a direct message to a single Twitter recipient.  This module
#	was inspired by others but became a rewrite to more formal modular
#	functions using objects which perhaps can spur additional development
#	interest and community-contributed growth and hopefully simplify required
#	code changes to address Twitter API changes in the future!
